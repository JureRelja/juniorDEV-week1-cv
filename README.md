In March 2023 I attended a 2-month long React education at [Digitalna Dalmacija](https://digitalnadalmacija.hr/). The education lasted for 8 weeks, and every week I was required to build a new project. This is the projects I build in the 1st week.

### What I learned

The first week was very easy. I had an advantage that I was already quite familiar with React and as a result didn't have any dificulties in the start, unlike some of other participants who newer used React before the education.
